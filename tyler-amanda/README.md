# Kilovolt Blog! "Lab 07: NodeJS and NPM"

**Author**: Tyler Pearson and Amanda Moen
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We want to add the ability to run a local node server to our application. We want to be able to create new articles and allow those new articles to be retrieved via the local node server.

## Getting Started
A user must install express, locally, on their machine, and then run a node server on their local host. The user has to set their port with a default of 3000, set up the routes, and set the application to listen from their port.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ExpressJS, NodeJS, node and nodemon, JSON, etc.

## Change Log
06-13-2018 12:00pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
06-13-2018 1:25pm - Completed the comments, and created/completed the README.md.
06-13-2018 3:30pm - Added a /.new route to the new.html page

## Credits and Collaborations
